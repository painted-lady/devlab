                <br>- In the emails users preferred either icons only or bold text only, but not both. But they prefer just bold text.
                <br>- Users would keep the title of the email as not a link, would only have one link to the certificate because it might generate multiple copies.
                <br>- The wording on the emails felt “pandering and not endearing” they preferred it to say “Congratulations” or something more formal/serious.
                <br>- No need for icons on the email.
                <br>- They don’t mind having 2 links to download (one in the title, one in the body) but that it should be made clear it will download something, otherwise they wouldn’t like it.
                <br>- They like the Ace drawing.
                <br>- They would have the links next to the icons, not underneath header text.
                <br>- They like the icons.

We utylized users feedback and changed the parts in the previous versions of our wireframes, which weren’t intuitive / effective enough. in the final version of the prototype we wanted to make sure that usres are not taking any unnecesarry steps towards getting access to desired certificates.

<div class="main-text">We tested our hi-fidelity prototypes using a Maze tool with 5 users who were between 15-17 yo. It helped us visualize the hitmaps, where users were clicking and if they flow was stereamlined enough. As we collected the results we found out that the average time to complete the task was 12 minutes and a misclick rate only 12 %. One of the users left the following feedback:

<h1 class="margins text-center">Conclusions</h1>

<div class="main-text">We found out that understanding the expectations of a generation that grew up with technology and the internet isn’t easy. We were very glad that our research wasn’t based just on the articles and statistics. We reached out to a group of teenagers who told us, how the user experience look like from their point of view. We were suprised many times during our interviews and usability testing. Deep understanding of teens motivations and needs helped us with designing solutions that could solve one of the Aceable’s problems.

<h1 class="margins text-center">Testimonials</h1>

<div class="main-text">“ From the Customer Experience  side, for the certificate solution, I thought it was so much more clear, direct, and helpful. I felt as tough it would significantly reduce CX contacts by guiding them to how to self-solve for downloading their certificate. I love the emphasis on printing it out, and including a way for them to send it themselves in-app to another person who could print it for them. To me this would be a huge CX win and cut down on unnecessary contacts while also helping students feel more empowered in ownership of this process”
